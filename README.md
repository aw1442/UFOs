# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To use the new webpage, search criteria can be used basedon table filters for date, city, state, country, and shape. For example, one can search for all UFO sightings in the state of 'ca' on 1/1/2020 by entering 'ca' for the state and 1/1/2020 for the date.

In order to conduct a new search, one can click the 'UFO Sightings' button to refresh the page.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that in order to conduct a new search, one has to click the 'UFO Sightings' button to refresh the page and one may lose the previous results if not recorded separately.

An additional recommendation for further development can be adding dynamic changes to the table so results can be seen in real-time without clicking any buttons or refreshing the page. Another recommendation for further development can be including additional parameters such as duration or comments.
